# MNIST_deep_learning
MNIST handwritten digits recognition using deep learning techniques

The objective for this project was to see how an additional hidden layer 
with nonlinear activation function improved the accuracy of the classification. 
For that reason, I started testing with a simple MaxEnt classifier, then 
a simple neural network with only one hidden layer, and finally multiple 
hidden layers. 
Moreover, since convolutional neural networks are known to better generalize 
in image recognition tasks, because of the aspects like scaling, position and 
alignment of an object inside the image, I also experimented with convolutional 
neural network.

The work is done using Theano for Python and Lasagne as a high level neural
network library.
